# FNISR1013D scope waveform decode

Work in progress.

This is a set of files helping an investigation decoding the waveform (.wav) files from a FNISR1013D tablet oscilloscope.
These are 15000 byte binary files containing, bufffer data, display data and settings when a capture is made.

The aim is to produce a conversion tool that can make this available in a readable and computable form.

The vbscript file screendump.vbs is an evolving script that is picking apart the wav file as the investigation proceeds.
